# Textbook Search Django
Visit the website at www.textbookcheap.net

This is a website built using the Django framework that uses webscraping to compose a list of textbook prices.
Webscrapers were written in Python using the requests and beautifulsoup libraries. They can be found under the WebScrapers folder, along with a product class designed to help sort the products.
